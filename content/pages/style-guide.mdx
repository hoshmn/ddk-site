### Code

Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or
markup source code. Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines
of a code block are interpreted literally. Markdown wraps a code block
in both `<pre>` and `<code>` tags.

To indicate a span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes (`` ` ``).
Unlike a pre-formatted code block, a `code span` indicates code within a
normal paragraph.

Sample line of code:

```html
<iframe href="example.html"></iframe>
```

Sample block of code:

```js
module.exports = (themeOptions) => {
  const contentPath = themeOptions.contentPath || `content/pages`
  const assetPath = themeOptions.assetPath || `content/assets`

  return {
    contentPath,
    assetPath,
  }
}
```

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
> consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.
> Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
>
> Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse
> id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.

### Links

This is [an example](https://www.google.com) link.

[This link](https://www.google.com) has no title attribute and is in a longer set of words. Let's see how long I can type before I get bored and stop typing. Here is me filling in some more spaces. And wow we have [encountered another link](https://www.google.com) in the wild!

### Buttons

<button>Sample Button</button>

### Tables

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Heading</th>
      <th>Another Heading</th>
      <th>More Heading</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Something</td>
      <td>124891</td>
      <td>Default is volcanoes.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Strange</td>
      <td>1098731</td>
      <td>Some longer text to test how it looks</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Is</td>
      <td>1874</td>
      <td>Oranges are better than apples.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Happening</td>
      <td>912641969</td>
      <td>To the moon and back.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Lists

Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.

Unordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens -- interchangably
-- as list markers:

- Red
- Green
- Blue

Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods:

1.  Bird
2.  McHale
3.  Parish

### Emphasis

_single underscores_

_Some more text in italics to get a better feel for how it can look. Here it goes just continuing on._

**double asterisks**

**Some more BOLD text. This really draws attention to it and helps to give a feel for what it looks like just a bit longer.**
